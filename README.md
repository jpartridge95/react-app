#Budgeting Application

Very simple application using useState and useEffect hooks.
The goal of this was to very briefly introduce myself to functional components, 
and over the course of a few days (1.5 of which on CSS, I know that seems like too long),
I did achieve this goal.

After using class components for another application I now feel as if I am at a good
place in my React journey.

Hopefully you find this small application to be if nothing else a bit of fun to play with,
hopefully though you think it's something worth spending more than a day fighting with CSS over.
